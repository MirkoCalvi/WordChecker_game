# WordChecker_game

During the second year of computer engineering at Politecnico of Milan I take part to Algorithms and Priciples of Informatic. I'd loved that course! 
In the second part of the accademic year our professor propose to us a pretty challenging request. The aim of the project was to realize a WordChecker algorithm to play
a MasterMind-like game, nothing special you would say, except for the fact that we had to observe precise limits of memory and time.

I found it very interesting. It helped me to deeply comprehend and optimize each singol aspect of my code
